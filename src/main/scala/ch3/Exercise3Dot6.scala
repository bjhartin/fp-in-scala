    // Question: Why canâ€™t this function be implemented in constant time like
    // tail?

    // Answer: Like any singly linked list, we walk from head to tail and can't know we're at the
    // tail until we get there.  Thus we don't have a `Cons2(xs, x)` which accesses the last
    // element in constant time.
